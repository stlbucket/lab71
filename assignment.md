Full-Stack Application Development Code Assessment

In this code assessment, you will be tasked with implementing a = full-stack cloud-based solution with a web front end featuring a product li= sting page (PLP). The PLP is powered by a RESTful API on the backend. The a= ssessment will focus on your ability to implement the provided user stories= and meet the specified technical requirements.

Notes & Hints:
The User stories are intentionally ke= pt high-level. Make some reasonable assumptions about the specific acceptan= ce criteria of each. Don=E2=80=99t spend too much time on any one feature, = especially the ones related to UI theming. The use of frameworks and code l= ibraries, such as AWS Amplify and CDK is encouraged. We are really looking = at your development and documentation abilities. This assessment should tak= e 3-6 hours to complete.
User = Stories

    As a user, I want the application to have a responsive UI that adapt= s to different screen sizes.

    As a user, I want the application to use the general look and feel o= f https://www.presshall.com.

    As a user, I want to view a list of products on a product listing pa= ge driven by the data in the products.json file.

    As a user, I want the product listing page to support sorting and pa= gination of the product results.

    As a user, I want the product listing page to filter by a keyword se= arch (*bonus).

Technical Requirements

You are required to meet the following technical requirements for the im= plementation of the full-stack solution:

    Web Front End:

        Implement the web front end using a reactive JavaScript framework, s= uch as React, Vue, or Angular.

        Ensure the UI is mobile-first and responsive, adapting to different = screen sizes. Demonstrate the use of media queries as well as fluid design.=

        Apply the general look and feel of https://www.presshall.com/ to the application. Don=E2=80=99t spend = too much time on this, we are just looking to your abilities to stylize UIs= , including container widths, fonts and spacing.

        Try to structure the application with CDN caching in mind, such as s= erving a maximum cache time for static assets and a small / no cache time f= or API endpoints, versioning script packages, etc.

    PLP/Search Functionality:

        Develop a RESTful API using Node.js to provide the product listing p= age (PLP) and search functionality.

        Utilize a cloud-based serverless technology, such as AWS API Gateway= + Lambda or the equivalent for GCP or MS Azure.

            This API should store the product data in a serverless database, suc= h as AWS DynamoDB, GCP BigTable or Azure Cosmos DB.

        Implement sorting and pagination of product results in the API.
        <= /li> 

    Code Packaging & Documentation:

        Package the code as a single repository, with separate projects for = the front end and the API.

        Include documentation that explains the code structure and details f= or both projects in their associated readme=E2=80=99s.

        Provide clear instructions for deploying the front end and the API p= roject in their associated readme=E2=80=99s.

    Automated Deployments (Bonus):

        As a bonus, the front-end project can include a script to deploy the= application to the CDN and invalidate the CDN cache after deployment.
        <= /li>

        The API project can provide a script, using infrastructure as code t= ools such as AWS CDK, to deploy the API to the cloud.
